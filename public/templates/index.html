<p>The Assessor’s Intranet site is a comprehensive and fast way to find out
    what’s going on in our department. As the site develops, it will be your
    link for interest to the Valuator newsletter and press releases – as
    well as promotional opportunities. I hope you find it helpful and use
    it on a regular basis.
